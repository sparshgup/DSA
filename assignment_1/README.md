# Assignment 1

### Hello Kotlin!

**1. What features do you like about Kotlin?**

- The type inference is a good thing to have in Kotlin, unlike in languages like C.
- The extension functions are such a nice thing and reduces effort.
- We can easily leverage existing Java libraries.
- Removes the need for explicit casting.
- `when` for having conditional branches is very thoughtful.
- The Single-function expressions is a little thing but would simplify so much code.
- Data classes would be very helpful when using classes for custom data types.
- I have seen programming languages have problems with null pointer exceptions, and it is handled elegantly 
in Kotlin so that developers can avoid having them.

**2. Are there things you were expecting to find that you havenâ€™t?**

- The conditional expression syntax is similar to C/C++ so was also expecting a similar format for ternary operator `condition ? then : else` but it is different (could be debated that it is more intuitive in Kotlin).
- Although I haven't worked with Java, I was expecting the syntax to be more like it. However, it looks to me like certain things are similar in syntax to  C and, surprisingly, Haskell.

**3. What questions do you have?**

- I'm curious to know why Kotlin has both read-only and mutable types for Collections data types and what exactly would be the specific reasons or use-cases for this?
